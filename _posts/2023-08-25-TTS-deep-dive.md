## What's TTS
 
Text-to-speech (TTS) stands as a captivating technology that converts written text into `spoken language`. This innovation enables computers and devices to interact audibly with users, seamlessly turning written information into speech that sounds completely natural.

The potential of TTS knows no bounds: from enriching accessibility for those with `visual impairments` to crafting captivating voice-overs for `multimedia content`.

Utilizing `advanced algorithms` and `linguistic models`, TTS systems **normalize**, **analyze input text**, utilize methods to **synthesize speech**, and **generate audio** output that skillfully replicates human speech patterns, intonation, and even emotions.
In the field of Text-to-Speech (TTS) solutions, diverse companies offer tools. **Amazon**'s Polly provides lifelike voices with customization, **Google**'s Text-to-Speech employs deep learning for natural speech synthesis, and **Microsoft**'s Azure Cognitive Services offers cloud-powered voice customization. These solutions reflect technological innovation, catering to a wide array of applications and showcasing the dynamic evolution of the TTS landscape.
## TTS's subtasks 
Generating speech from text is essentially based on **2** main subtasks :

the first subtask is **Mel-Spectrogram prediction** which is a technique commonly used in audio processing, particularly in `TTS` and `ASR`( Automatic Speech Recognition) that aims to predict the mel-spectrogram representation of an audio signal .

The second main subtask is generating the actual audio 
**waveform** from the **mel-spectrogram**. 




## First subtask : Mel-Spectrogram prediction
before we go further let's break down some terms :

**Fourier Transform:**Fourier transform is a `mathematical` technique that decomposes a `complex` signal into its constituent **frequency components**.

**Mel-Spectrogram:** it is a visual representation of the frequency content of an audio signal over time. It is obtained by taking the **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)** of the audio signal and then mapping the resulting frequency bins onto the Mel scale, which is a scale that better represents the way **humans** perceive differences in **pitch**.

Mel-spectrograms are widely used in speech and audio analysis because they capture the signal's frequency and `time-domain` information.

**Prediction:** In the context of mel-spectrogram prediction, a machine learning model is trained to predict the mel-spectrogram representation of an audio signal based on some input data. 
This input data could be text (in the case of TTS) or raw audio waveform (in the case of ASR).

## Second subtask : waveform synthesis

The second main subtask is generating the actual audio **waveform** from the mel-spectrogram.

A waveform of audio is a `visual representation` illustrating how air pressure changes over time, capturing the amplitude variations that create sound.

 In other words, it's the process of converting the visual representation of the mel-spectrogram back into sound. This can be done using various techniques such as traditional signal processing methods like `Griffin-Lim` algorithm or more advanced methods like neural waveform synthesis models such as `WaveGAN`, `WaveNet`, and more recently, `WaveGlow` and `Tacotron`.

Explaining each one of these models requires a whole article itself.

## Why is TTS complicated?

**1-Confused words** 

try to read these two phrases :

`"I prefer bass fishing to play the bass guitar"`

`"Do you live near a zoo with live animals ?"`

In these instances, the word **"bass"** takes on separate meanings depending on whether it refers to a type of fish or a musical instrument. 

Similarly, the term **"live"** can indicate either "being alive" or "a live performance." Such words with multiple pronunciations and meanings are referred to as **confused words** as they can lead to ambiguity and the need for contextual interpretation.

**2-Text Normalization**

TTS systems require preprocessing for handling non-standard words 
like: **numbers ,monetary amounts,abbreviations , dates,Acronyms**

look at these  examples:


`The African economy in 2023`

`the password is 2023`

`it costs 2023 dollars`

For the first example, 2023 is commonly pronounced: 
`"twenty-twenty-three"` .


For the second example,2023 is commonly pronounced `"two zero two three"` .


For the second example,2023 is commonly pronounced `"two thousand twenty-three"` .

In bref, the pronunciation of a word depends not only on the `embedding` of a word but depends on the **context**.
In other words in depends basically on  `the neighboring  tokens`

the technology behind text normalization and many aspects of **text-to-speech (TTS)** involves **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques :

**Tokenization :** Tokenization involves breaking down text into `smaller units`, such as words or subword units. This process is essential for understanding the context and structure of the text, which is crucial for accurate pronunciation.

**Part-of-Speech :** Tagging: This involves identifying the **grammatical parts** of speech (e.g., `nouns, verbs, adjectives`) in a sentence. Part-of-speech information helps in determining how words should be pronounced in context.

**Named Entity Recognition (NER) :** NER is used to identify entities such as dates, numbers, currency symbols, and other special terms. This information is vital for accurately normalizing and pronouncing such entities.

**Numerical and Date Processing:** NLP models can be trained to understand different numerical formats and date expressions, allowing them to convert these into appropriate spoken forms.

**Language Modeling:** Language models like transformers are used to understand the context of words and phrases in a sentence. They capture relationships between words and contribute to `context-aware` text normalization.

**Rule-Based Systems:** Traditional rule-based approaches define `explicit rules` for how certain terms or patterns should be normalized and pronounced. These rules can handle common cases but might lack the flexibility of `machine learning` approaches.

**Contextual Analysis:** Contextual analysis models, including contextual `embeddings` and `transformers`, are used to understand the surrounding words and phrases to determine **pronunciation patterns**.



**3-Abbrevition and aronyms** 

Acronyms and abbreviations present specific challenges in text-to-speech (TTS) because their pronunciation can vary based on **context**, **language**, and **domain** .

first of all Abbreviations  need to be deciphered into their original forms.

Here are a few ways TTS systems handle acronyms :

**Predefined Pronunciation Rules:** TTS systems often include predefined pronunciation rules for common acronyms and abbreviations. These rules guide the system on how to pronounce specific sequences of letters. For instance, "NASA" might be pronounced as individual letters ("N. A. S. A.") or as a word ("nasa").

**Contextual Analysis:** Advanced TTS systems can analyze the surrounding context to determine the appropriate pronunciation. For example, if the surrounding text contains words related to science and space, the system might pronounce `"NASA"` as the space agency rather than individual letters.

**User-Defined Pronunciations:** Some TTS systems allow users or developers to provide `**custom pronunciations** for specific acronyms or abbreviations. This is particularly useful for domain-specific terminology that might not be handled accurately by default rules.

**Lexicon Expansion:** TTS systems often use `lexicons`or `dictionaries` that map words to their corresponding phonetic representations. These lexicons can include entries for **acronyms** and **abbreviations**, along with their correct pronunciations.

**Adaptive Learning:** Modern TTS systems can employ **machine learning techniques** to adapt pronunciation based on the training data and user feedback. If an `acronym` or `abbreviation` is frequently encountered, the system might learn to pronounce it correctly from **context**.

## Conclusion 
In this article, we've come to realize that the TTS system is far from being a mystical `black box`. 

Instead, it is rooted in a comprehensive theory, consisting of two significant subtasks: `Mel-Spectrogram prediction` and `waveform analysis`.

In upcoming articles, we'll delve into the practical aspect, where we'll put several models to the test with actual code. **Stay tuned  for more insights !**
